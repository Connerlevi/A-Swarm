# A-SWARM Project Context - Development Environment

## Development Environment Overview

**This is the PROTOTYPE/DEVELOPMENT environment** for A-SWARM (Autonomic Security for Workload And Resource Management). This environment contains the complete production foundation plus enhanced features under development.

**Synchronization Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - All production files from main/ have been synchronized to prototype/

**Development Workflow**: 
1. **Development**: `prototype/` (this environment - complete feature set)
2. **Testing**: Validate enhancements in prototype environment  
3. **Production**: Promote stable features to `main/` for deployment
4. **GitHub**: Sync stable changes from `main/` to GitHub repository

A-SWARM is a distributed defense system providing autonomous detection and containment of security anomalies in Kubernetes environments using biological swarm intelligence principles.

## Current Status: Production-Ready v1.0 with Enhanced Fast-Path

### Achieved Capabilities

✅ **Sub-millisecond Detection**: P95 0.08ms via UDP fast-path (target: <200ms)  
✅ **Dual-path Architecture**: UDP fast-path + Kubernetes Lease audit trail  
✅ **Fast Response**: P95 MTTR < 1.3s for containment actions  
✅ **Detection Reliability (testbed)**: 100% across 500+ synthetic anomalies  
✅ **Production Deployment**: Complete YAML with security hardening  
✅ **Supply Chain Security**: HMAC authentication, replay protection  
✅ **Evidence Generation**: Comprehensive audit trails and compliance reports  
✅ **Back-pressure Control**: Ring buffer with per-IP rate limiting and adaptive degradation  
✅ **Crash Recovery**: WAL-based persistence with boot-time replay  
✅ **Kill-Switch Governance**: Dual-control approval workflow for emergency operations  
✅ **Real-time API**: FastAPI backend with WebSocket streaming for monitoring UI  

### Architecture Components

#### Core Components
- **Sentinel**: DaemonSet with dual-path signaling (UDP fast-path + Kubernetes Leases)
- **Pheromone**: Deployment with enhanced UDP listener, back-pressure control, and crash recovery
- **Fast-Path**: HMAC-authenticated UDP with replay protection achieving <1ms detection latency
- **MicroAct**: Executor that applies graduated containment actions (Ring 1-5)
- **Kill-Switch**: Dual-control governance system for emergency operations
- **API Backend**: Real-time FastAPI server with WebSocket streaming and monitoring

#### Production Infrastructure
- **Helm Packaging**: Production-ready charts with RBAC, network policies, monitoring
- **Container Security**: Cosign-signed images with comprehensive SBOMs  
- **Evidence Pack**: Automated generation of compliance and audit reports
- **WAL Persistence**: Write-ahead logging with fsync batching for crash recovery
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP token buckets with 100 capacity, 50/s refill
- **API Authentication**: Configurable API keys for kill-switch governance
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket streams with thread-safe event distribution

## Technical Performance

### SLO Achievement Status
- **P95 MTTD < 200ms**: ✅ **ACHIEVED** (UDP fast-path: 0.08ms in testbed)
- **P95 MTTR < 5s**: ✅ **ACHIEVED** (actual: ~0.8-1.2s)
- **Observed Detection Rate (testbed)**: 100% across 500+ synthetic anomalies
- **Observed False Positives (testbed)**: 0 across 200+ normal operations (hysteresis enabled)

### Dual-Path Performance
- **UDP Fast-Path**: P95 0.08ms for high-confidence alerts (score ≥0.90)
- **Kubernetes Leases**: ~1.5-1.7s for audit trail and low-confidence signals
- **Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 with replay protection
- **Reliability**: 3x packet duplication with 6ms gaps

### Key Optimizations Applied
1. **UDP Fast-Path**: Sub-millisecond bypass for high-confidence alerts
2. **Enhanced Protocol**: V3 format with src_id, nonce32, and protocol compatibility
3. **Ring Buffer**: Drop-oldest policy with 20K capacity and condition variable
4. **Back-pressure Control**: Per-IP rate limiting with adaptive degradation to audit-only mode
5. **Crash Recovery**: WAL with fsync batching, never drops uncommitted entries
6. **Replay Protection**: Per-source sequence tracking with 5-second timestamp window
7. **Kill-Switch Governance**: ConfigMap-based dual-control approval workflow
8. **Thread-safe API**: WebSocket streaming with call_soon_threadsafe for multi-threading

### Architectural Design Decisions
- **Kubernetes API Floor**: ~1.5s minimum for Lease propagation (now bypassed by UDP)
  - Lease path remains as reliability/audit backstop
  - UDP fast-path achieves <1ms for high-confidence alerts
- **Dual-Path Benefits**: Speed (UDP) + Reliability (Leases) + Audit trail
- **Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 with configurable keys for security
- **Network Partition Tolerance**: UDP provides immediate local alerting

## Supply Chain Security

### Image Signing & Verification
- **Keyless Signatures**: GitHub OIDC-based signing with cosign
- **Multi-format SBOMs**: SPDX 2.3, CycloneDX 1.4, Syft native formats
- **SLSA Attestations**: Build provenance and vulnerability scan results
- **Policy Enforcement**: Cosign admission controller integration

### Compliance Features
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Access controls, vulnerability management, encryption
- **License Compliance**: Automated scanning with approved/restricted lists
- **Audit Trail**: Complete action certificates with cryptographic integrity
- **Vulnerability Management**: Continuous scanning with tiered response SLAs

## Deployment Options

### 1. Fast-Path Production Deployment (Recommended)
```powershell
# Single-command deployment
.\deploy\deploy-fastpath.ps1

# Comprehensive verification
.\deploy\verify-fastpath-fixed.ps1

# Performance validation
python scripts/test_fastpath_simple.py
```

### 2. Legacy Helm Deployment
```bash
# Install with production values
helm install aswarm ./helm/aswarm -f values-production.yaml

# Build and sign images
make build-images-prod

# Verify supply chain integrity
make verify-images && make security-scan
```

## Evidence & Reporting

### Action Certificates
- Cryptographically signed JSON artifacts for each containment action
- Includes MTTD/MTTR metrics, policy hashes, probe results
- Stored in `ActionCertificates/` with ISO timestamp naming

### Evidence Pack Generator
- Comprehensive ZIP package with KPI reports, SIEM exports, audit data
- Executive dashboard (kpi_report.html) with SLO compliance status
- Machine-readable formats for integration with security tools

### Monitoring Integration
- Prometheus metrics for all components and actions
- Grafana dashboards for real-time operational visibility
- Alert manager integration for SLO violations and security events

## Micro-Containment Catalog v0.2

### Ring-Based Actions (1-5, escalating impact)
- **Ring 1**: Network isolation (NetworkPolicy)
- **Ring 2**: Resource quotas, priority class downgrade
- **Ring 3**: IdP token revocation, egress rate limiting  
- **Ring 4**: Node quarantine, workload migration
- **Ring 5**: Namespace lockdown, emergency procedures

### Safety Mechanisms
- **TTL Auto-revert**: All actions automatically reverse after configured timeout
- **DRY_RUN Mode**: Test actions without applying changes
- **Thread-safe Operations**: Concurrent action handling with proper locking
- **Kill Switch Integration**: Per-component and per-ring disable capabilities

## Certificate Signing & Security

### Current Implementation
- **Demo**: HMAC-based signatures for action certificates
- **Production Path**: Interface designed for KMS/HSM integration
- **Audit Trail**: Complete cryptographic chain of custody

## TTL Implementation Details

### Auto-revert Mechanism
- **Check Interval**: 5 seconds (expect minor jitter on exact expiry)
- **Time Source**: Monotonic clock for reliability
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent action handling with proper locking
- **Idempotency**: Re-apply safe, missing resources on revert don't error

## Security Considerations

### Runtime Security
- **Pod Security Standards**: Restricted profile enforced by default
- **RBAC**: Minimal permissions per component with principle of least privilege
- **Network Policies**: Default-deny with explicit component communication rules
- **Non-root Containers**: All images run as UID 65532 with read-only filesystem

### Operational Security  
- **Kill Switch**: Global emergency disable with HMAC-protected state changes
- **Audit Logging**: All enforcement actions generate structured audit events
- **Secret Management**: Proper handling of keys for kill switch and fast-path UDP
- **Incident Response**: Documented playbook for security incidents

## Development Evolution

### Major Milestones
1. **v0.1**: Basic proof-of-concept with polling-based detection
2. **v0.8**: Lease-based signaling with sliding window detection  
3. **v0.9**: Optimized for sub-second MTTD targeting (fast-path, background writes)
4. **v1.0**: Production-ready with Helm, signing, evidence generation
