# A-SWARM System Test Plan (Integrated)
*Created: 2025-01-19 — Consolidated for Pilot & 3rd-Party Readiness*

## Executive Summary

This plan battle-tests A-SWARM's autonomous cyber-immune system ahead of third-party validation. It covers component, integration, performance, resilience, and security testing, and adds deployment/runbook steps, observability, and hardening gates so the system is both heavily tested and easily deployable.

### Primary Goals
- **Prove end-to-end pipeline**: Arena combat → Evolution fitness → Population update → Federation sharing
- **Validate performance SLOs**: Sub-ms detection, bounded evolution time, reliable federation
- **Verify production resilience**: Rate limiting, replay guard, chaos recovery
- **Ship easy deployment**: One-command smokes and clear rollback procedures

## Environments & Dependencies

### Test Environments
- **Dev-Local**: Single cluster (3 nodes min) for component & integration tests
- **Pilot-Staging**: 2–3 clusters (alpha/beta/gamma) across regions for federation & chaos
- **Load Cell**: Scaled cluster for performance (optional burst workers)

### Secrets/Identity
- Ed25519 keys in KMS (monthly rotation plan)
- (Optional) mTLS via SPIRE/SPIFFE; Python clients trust bundle mounted

### Configuration Knobs

#### Evolution
```bash
EVOLUTION_ADDR=:50051
EVOLUTION_SEED=20250920
EVOLUTION_MAX_POP=500
EVOLUTION_MUTATION_RATE=0.10
EVOLUTION_ELITE_COUNT=3
EVOLUTION_PROMOTE_THRESHOLD=0.70
```

#### Federation
```bash
FEDERATION_ADDR=:9443
FED_RATELIMIT_RPM=600
FED_REPLAY_TTL=10m
FED_TRUST_MIN=0.60
FED_QC_QUORUM=3
FED_HLL_PRECISION=14
FED_HLL_SALT=<uint64 non-zero>
```

FEDERATION_ADDR=host:9443
SMOKE_TIMEOUT=5.0
HLL_FIXTURE=/path/to/valid.hll   # recommended
```

---

## Pre-Flight & Runbook

### Pre-Flight (once)
- [ ] `go mod tidy && make protobuf && make build`
- [ ] Generate real HLL fixture from Go HLL → `tests/fixtures/hll/valid.hll`
- [ ] Pin enum strings: `attack_signature|behavior_pattern|anomaly_detection|threat_intelligence`
- [ ] Pin blast radius: `none|container|node|cluster`
- [ ] Decide RNG seed (`EVOLUTION_SEED`) for deterministic CI

### Start/Stop
```bash
# Start servers
./bin/evolution-server &
./bin/federation-server &

# Validate
make e2e-smoke
python3 tests/smoke_evolution.py
python3 tests/smoke_federation.py
python3 tests/smoke_integration.py
```

### Rollback (≤2 minutes)
1. Pause federation (stop outgoing shares)
2. Disable new evolution cycles (read-only mode)
3. ArgoCD rollback to last known-good images/configs
4. Re-enable in reverse order with smokes between steps

---

## Observability & SLOs

### Metrics to Scrape
| Component | Metrics |
|-----------|---------|
| **Evolution** | `generation`, `best_fitness`, `avg_fitness`, `diversity`, `eval_latency_p95` |
| **Population** | `population_size`, `stale_antibodies` |
| **Federation** | `share_success_rate`, `replay_hits`, `ratelimit_rejections`, `peer_trust` |
| **HLL** | `merges_per_sec`, `zero_register_ratio`, `std_error` |
| **Infra/gRPC** | `grpc_requests_total{code}`, `queue_depth`, CPU/Mem |

### Alerting (pilot)
- Fitness `extended_fitness` drops >20% from 7-day median
- Quorum failures >5 min
- RL rejections > 5/min sustained 10 min
- Any HLL hash mismatch

## Deployment Ease & Known Foot-Guns

### Do ✅
- Use real HLL bytes in federation tests (codec MarshalBinary), not ad-hoc hashes
- Always set nonce + sequence in ShareSketch/RequestSketch
- Keep HLL precision/salt/version in metadata
- Seed RNG (`EVOLUTION_SEED`) for deterministic CI

### Avoid ❌
- Enum drift in Python clients (strings must match proto)
- Running without RL/ReplayGuard in federation
- Unpinned proto changes—reserve fields and stick to minor bumps

---

## Reporting & Handoff

### Artifacts
- `TEST_REPORT.md` and `TEST_REPORT_FINAL.md` with SLO summaries, graphs, and red/amber/green statuses
- Exported Grafana dashboards (JSON) and Prometheus rule groups
- Runbook PDF (start/stop, common failures, rollback)
- List of known issues & waivers (with mitigation)

### Third-Party Handoff Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing per "Success Criteria"
- [ ] Metrics/dashboards accessible
- [ ] Credentials and ephemeral keys provisioned (scoped)
- [ ] mTLS or documented exception
- [ ] Rollback verified
- [ ] HLL fixtures and federation peers pre-configured
